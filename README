A simple pyside gui example
---------------------------

simple.ui is generated by qt designer
simple_generated.py is generated by running `pyside-uic simple.ui > simple_generated.py`
simple.py - is an edited version of simple_generated.py that is edited to connect the button `clicked()` signal to another method in the gui class.
